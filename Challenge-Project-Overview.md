## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes
*(This section is for BTT staff only — remove before sharing with students)*

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Python Compatibility | 🟢 | The tech stack is centered on Python and uses established ML libraries for classification, regression, NLP, and time series analysis. |
| Data Readiness |  🟢 | The dataset is publicly available and under 1GB, ensuring it is manageable and ready for use without extensive cleansing. |
| Resource Check | 🟢 |  While the project is designed for free-tier environments like Google Colab, students may need to explore open-source alternatives if they choose to incorporate LLMs |

**Student Fit Score:** 8/10  
**Technical Depth Score:** 7/10  
**Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

**Advisor Feedback Draft:**
The project represents a timely and impactful area of exploration, allowing students to leverage a mix of ML techniques in a significant domain. However, consider two adjustments: refine the success metrics to prioritize actionable insights over purely numerical outcomes, and ensure that all team members have a sufficient understanding of advanced techniques such as LLMs before implementation. Let's leverage this project to deepen Fellow's understanding of the real-world applications of ML in supply chain management.

## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
Build an AI system that can predict supply chain disruptions and recommend mitigation actions using operational + contextual data.

### Success Criteria

**Model Performance (30%)**   
- Classification: ROC-AUC / F1-score   
- Regression: RMSE / MAE

**Resilience Intelligence (25%)**   
Quality of risk scoring   
Ability to:   
- Identify high-risk suppliers/routes   
- Detect early warning signals

**Business Impact (20%)**
Clear articulation of:   
- Cost reduction   
- Service level improvement

**Explainability & Storytelling (15%)**   
Executive narrative   
Visual dashboards (aligns with your AI4BI focus)   

**Innovation (10%)**   
Use of:   
- Graph ML / simulation models  
- Scenario planning   

### Stretch Goals
The stretch goal will be to provided recommended actions based on the supply chain disruptions. This may not be completed within the three months window.

### Project Milestones
Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a GitHub Projects board to track tasks within each milestone. 
| Month | Milestone | Key Activities | 
|-------|-----------|----------------| 
| September | Working ML Model | [TBD] | 
| October | Fine-tuned ML Model | [TBD] | 
| November | Robust Working Model, should be able to work for real time scenarios. Predict the next supply chain disruptions. | [TBD] |
